 //A file to store the server and other configuration values

 /* If you're running DPMbox on the same server as a DPM node you should not touch
  * the server and root parameters as they will be obtained automatically from the
  * location.
  * If you are using DPMbox to connect to an external DPM or WebDAV server, please
  * assign these values appropiately. The server value must be like
  * 'http://http://lxfsra04a04.cern.ch'
  * and the root parameter (the directory at where the interface will start to read content)
  * must be some thing like '/dpm/cern.ch/home/dteam/aalvarez/public/' (ending backslash needed).
